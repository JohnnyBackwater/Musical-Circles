# Musical-Circles
Musical circles graphical program, inspired by Krazydad's Withey music box (link: http://whitneymusicbox.org). Sound is still missing but you can play with different number of circles going around the center. 

Each little dot, as they grow bigger it takes twice as much time to complete a full revolution than the other before it. This produces nice little effects. I add more features as I can think more of them. This application does not have a sound, but thats work in progress.
